# Java Practice Programs

This repository contains my practice programs in Java.  
The goal is to learn Java fundamentals, object-oriented programming, and common problem-solving techniques.

## Structure
- `basics/` → First programs (print, input, variables)
- `control_flow/` → if/else, switch, loops
- `functions/` → methods, recursion
- `oop/` → classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/leosaikat10/JAVA.git
2. Compile a file:
   javac basics/HelloWorld.java
3. Run:
   java basics.HelloWorld

## Learning Roadmap
- ✅ Basics
- ✅ Control flow
- ⬜ Functions
- ⬜ Object-Oriented Programming
- ⬜ Data Structures
